Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================
INTRODUCTION
This repository was created for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" class offered by Coursera and provides my submission for the Course project.  There are two files in the repository:  codeBook.md and run_analysis.R.

The file codeBook.md contains a general description (variables and data) of the tidy data set that was created by running the script run_analysis.R as well as a summary of the transformations performed to clean up the data.

RAW DATA
The raw data was obtained from the url "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and is described at the site where the data was obtained:  "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and are described in the readme file provided by the expermenters who collected and prepared the dataset.
